    <div>
        <h2>Hang in there!</h2>
        <h5></h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Today when I was driving to my counseling appointment I was thinking that in a couple of weeks I have my scanning tests again. I felt overwhelmed when I evaluated the fact that I needed to do this kind of exams for about five years more at least twice a year. It is not that the test itself is painful or difficult but it is this giant reminder that I am always at risk. So, even though as time goes by and I fight the fears and anger of having been slapped by cancer while it completely changed my life when I finally get up to face life and feel so close to recover, the test day comes again and I can’t stop the anxiety that fills my heart. Then, a new view (I think from Heaven) comes to my mind and helps me reflect on how five years are nothing compared to a life time of health and happiness next to my family, bringing a new perspective to help me release the anxiety of my heart.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see my life almost completely stopped, feeling that for over a year I have had to fully devoted myself to recover my body and things that where a big part of me like being a mom or a professional had to be reduced to a bare minimum. However, I do appreciate the new perspective that I have gained about life and spirituality, and the awesome feeling of victory that comes when you are able to get up again.</p>
<p>The road to recovery is not easy, in cancer patients it is even more challenging because we have to learn that a cure has not been found and the risk of a relapse is always present. I have chosen to enjoy my life, to live every day as if it was my last. Last week I started school again and I am working to build a new career, one that I can develop with the abilities that I have now. I decided that I will not duel on the past anymore, on what I was or had but rebuilding a new, happy, strong me.</p>
<p>When I came out of my brain surgery, I was very happy, just the fact that I was still alive gave me the motivation to make it through the treatment and to fight the negative thoughts. I couldn’t understand why in the past I let so many things bother me or why I had settle for being unhappy, even though I had so much. I couldn’t understand why for so many years I kept resentment and pain. Now, as I go back to a more regular life, again life problems try to put me down but I want to remember every day for the rest of my life the feeling I had every morning after my surgery of being excited just because I was waking up and was going to enjoy my children one more time.</p>
