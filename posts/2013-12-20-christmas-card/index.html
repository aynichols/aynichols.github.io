    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Season’s greetings friends and family,</p>
<p>The gang is finally back together after Maria came back from Colombia to spend some time with us and we couldn’t be happier. We had our traditional Christmas photo shoot to select one picture that will represent what is going on in our life so we hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>This year started pretty difficult while I was going through a strong treatment of chemo and radiotherapy. When we thought things were finally coming to an end doctors found metastasis in my brain, it looked like nothing could be worse. I know that it might seem like it was a terrible year for our family but on the contrary we received many blessings. Our trails have made us grow. I felt God’s presence in my life like I never did before and the faith; joy and peace that I received wouldn’t have been possible without this rough path. Scott is focusing on his psychology degree and plans on finish it next year; he also has been an amazing husband and father supporting me in every way possible through my recovery. Maria went back to Colombia because she is close to finish high school and her plans for the future are there, so even though we miss her every day, we respect her decisions and she has proven to us that she deserves our trust with the excellent grades she is getting. Last but not least the two little ones enjoy their school, girl scouts and swimming and keep us positive and busy. We are still at my in laws house and enjoy their support, love and attention. I will be visiting my mom and family in Colombia after Christmas with the girls and know that I will be spoiled like always.</p>
<p>God is always good, we might not receive everything we want but we definitely receive what we need. I surrendered my life to Jesus 17 years ago and feel absolutely grateful that He has made me grow and that over everything He is always protecting my soul. We know that our life on earth has a specific purpose and every step is directed to fulfill it. We praise God for my healing and for the beautiful journey that He has walked with us this year, we thank all of you for the love that has helped us stay strong and we pray that next year we have many other blessings to tell you about.</p>
<p>“May the Lord bless you and protect you, May the Lord smile on you, May the Lord show you his favor and give you His peace.” Numbers 6:24-26</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
