		<b>Text:</b> Wow Nicky! You give me so much joy with your words. My purpose  in life has always been loving and caring for people and I really never know if I was able to make an impact in someone, but it is amazing that you have this desire in your heart to serve and love. That means the world to me. I will watch for you and see you grow while I am around and then from heaven. Much love kiddo!

		<b>Text:</b> Sometimes I wish I could go back to high school and Spanish class. As much as I hated learning a foreign language I really appreciate the fun times all of us in the class had. Making funny project videos or watching movies and all coming together as one big family. You helped me  out and lots of other students as well. I believe you gave us value and I think we all carry a piece of you inside us. I‚Äôm blessed that I can help you and I hope to help more people and change lives along my journey. I believe you helped me find my calling to help those in need

		<b>Text:</b> ü§£ I love it! I didnt even think about it but it was so nice to see your picture and your message. You know, I know I have done a lot with my life but sometimes I wonder if I let God used me to fulfill His purpose and knowing that I gave you any addition value to your life and other kids, it makes me feel that all this fight is worth it because I hope you remember me when you are down and know that there is no limit to how much you can fight, and always try your best! I know you will do great and that makes me happy. Don't be a stranger ‚ù§Ô∏è. PS: I know you feel guilty for my missing speech but you will have more opportunities so keep me in mind.

		<b>Text:</b> It is an amazing time in your life dont let anything take the joy of it. You have so many possibilities and you are so smart, just focus on making smart decisions even if that means that you need to take time to think about it. I know finding your calling can be stressful but you will figure it out.  Please stay in touch it makes me so happy, I miss teaching so much. Maybe you will mention my name in your college graduation speech since you didnt want to do in high school üòÅ.

		<b>Text:</b> I‚Äôm doing really well! School is still stressful and what not, but it can be fun. I‚Äôm currently not not dating Tracy anymore. We had a falling out and we thought the best thing to do was end our relationship. We still love each other, and we‚Äôll always help each other out, but I can‚Äôt love her like we used to. I‚Äôve had quite the journey so far. I‚Äôm currently kinda sorta talking to this girl. Nothing serious though. I‚Äôm just trying to find my calling in this world at the moment

		<b>Text:</b> Hi Nick! So nice to hear from you! I saw your picture yesterday on something and thought about you too. I am ok, I have been through a lot of different medicines and treatments including chemo, cancer continues to advance slowly but I know that is how this is going to work. I will have new tests in November and hope that they can have a new treatment that continues to delay cancer moving to other parts in my body. Anyway, I will be fine it is what it is. How are you? How is school? Are you still dating the same girl? I hope you are happy, I know there are grate things to come for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
