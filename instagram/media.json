As you know after listening to my testimony a few times, my journey through cancer has been about growing closer to God as He has healed my soul. By His Glory my experience has allowed others to find encouragement and hope for their own journey. I have embraced cancer as a cleansing time for my spirit and offered my life to God as an instrument, knowing that having terminal cancer is a painful experience but accepting a difficult path over my own desires to shine His love, peace and joy. In the past weeks, I have been approached  by different friends about their vision in my life for a complete healing and now I feel in my spirit that is time for me to declare God‚Äôs power to make a miracle and continue to use my journey to show His Glory. I felt this morning in my praying time that I should dedicate a specific time to pray and invite others to do it with me. We are asking God for a miracle, for complete healing by His power and for His Glory. We don‚Äôt need to be together in the same location but united in spirit at same time asking for God‚Äôs mercy. Also, I want to fast before my prayer time, not as a way to win God‚Äôs grace but to give more focus to His voice and receive guidance.\n\nHere is the invitation: \nI will start fasting Saturday April 20th at noon and culminate it in prayer with my Christian family, Sunday 21st at 8:00 am.\n\nI don‚Äôt expect everyone to fast but if you can join me on Sunday at 8 am Eastern time from anywhere you are, I believe God will listen to us and deliver His Grace and Mercy over me once again. Thank you for your love. \"Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
