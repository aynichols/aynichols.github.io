    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p><em>By Sara Nichols</em></p>
<p>I miss her laugh that could be heard across the room.</p>
<p>Her smile that could brighten anyone&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Her love for every single person in the world, no matter how rude they were.</p>
<p>Her patience for my two sisters and me.</p>
<p>Her despise for rodents.</p>
<p>Her funny storytelling skills.</p>
<p>Her yummy crepes she would make every morning.</p>
<p>Her goofy personality that could make anyone feel better.</p>
<p>Her huge disgust for milk even though I loved it.</p>
<p>Her terrible singing skills that she enjoyed so much.</p>
<p>Her perfect organizational habits.</p>
<p>Her warm and cozy hugs that could make me feel better no matter what.</p>
<p>Her unbarring love for God even through everything.</p>
<p>Her telling me I am so smart, beautiful, and kind, just like her.</p>
<p>Her strength to fight the battle she had to fight until it ended.</p>
<p>I miss how she thought the smallest things were funny.</p>
<p>How she couldn&rsquo;t say some words correctly so she made up her own.</p>
<p>How she said the funniest words with her accent.</p>
<p>How she would rant angrily in Spanish.</p>
<p>How she always put up with my attitude.</p>
<p>How she didn’t know the difference between a nickel and a penny.</p>
<p>How whenever I needed help she could always help me.</p>
<p>How she could make friends with literally anyone she met and she did.</p>
<p>How she would always try to understand me and get closer to me.</p>
<p>How she took me everywhere with her.</p>
<p>How she always complained about everywhere being cold.</p>
<p>How when she got mad it really brought out her accent.</p>
<p>How she would take me to run errands with her all the time.</p>
<p>How her hands were always warm when I would hold them.</p>
<p>How she would always try to get closer with her family.</p>
<p>How she refused to let anyone take her peace.</p>
<p>How she would make fun of me for every boy I ever talked about.</p>
<p>How she made us put sunscreen on every twenty minutes to ensure we didn’t get burnt.</p>
<p>How she knew each and every one of her daughter’s individual traits.</p>
<p>How she would pray the longest prayers every night.</p>
<p>I miss hearing about her life as a kid.</p>
<p>Hearing how she used to take dolls with her wherever she went.</p>
<p>Hearing about how her and my dad met and got married within less than a year.</p>
<p>I miss the wisdom she would share with me.</p>
<p>The way she so powerfully worshiped.</p>
<p>The time she took me to watch Twilight primer cause I was so obsessed.</p>
<p>The traditions we had with her for every holiday.</p>
<p>The funny jokes she would make during scary movies so we wouldn&rsquo;t be so scared.</p>
<p>The small spanish lessons she would give me on sundays at the table.</p>
<p>The way she had every little thing organized and knew where everything was.</p>
<p>The way she made everyone happy, like me, my sisters, and my dad.</p>
<p>The memories I got to make with her.</p>
<p>I miss when she raised enough money to take us all to Florida.</p>
<p>When we would go to the colombian restaurant every Sunday with her.</p>
<p>When she took me and Isa to swimming lessons and Olive Garden every Saturday.</p>
<p>When she took me to the movies for my birthday.</p>
<p>When she would invite me on all kinds of errands with her.</p>
<p>When she would get me up in the mornings.</p>
<p>When I didn’t have to be so independent.</p>
<p>When I got to spend time with her.</p>
<p>I miss her.</p>
